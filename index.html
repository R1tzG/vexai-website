I worked on fixing up the wiring for the 24-inch as well. On the 15 Inch, I was responsible for mounting both clamps and spacing out some of the internals.

                            <li>Usage of the TensorRT framework allowed us to transfer YOLOv5 computations from the nano's CPU to its much faster GPU.</li>
                            <li>Building the IntelRealsense drivers using CUDA rather than default settings allowed us to transfer camera frame processing tasks from the CPU to the GPU.</li>
                            <li>Powering the Jetson Nano through its GPIO pins in addition to the default barrel jack port allows us to supply the Nano with extra voltage and processing power.</li>

                        <p>
                            A list of all object locations computed by the Nano is sent to the V5 brain through a serial cable connecting the two. 
                            <br>
                            Once a list of data has been sent over to the V5 brain, we cross-check them against “deadzones” that the robot is not allowed to enter. For example, our robot should not be attempting to intake rings located under the balance. Once we determine which objects from this list are valid targets, we select the closest one and tell our robot to navigate towards it.

                            For simplicity, we define the field as a collection of 36 boxes. Using our robot's position and all YOLOv5 detections, we update each box with information about the number of rings and mogos inside at any given time.
                            <br>
                            Allows for the robot to have short term “memory” about the layout of areas of the field it has recently seen.

                            The 24” is designed primarily to fill alliance mogos with rings. This is because each alliance mogo filled with rings is worth 30 additional points. Each filled mogo is then deposited into a corner on our side of the field, where it can be picked up by the 15” and brought onto the balance, or remain in a relatively safe location for the rest of the match.

                            We use a holonomic x-drive as its strafing capabilities allow great maneuverability. However due to their angled wheels, X-drives are weak and bulky, so we use laser cut wheel hubs designed in CAD to make the most of our space with two motor mounts each for increased torque.

                        <p>
                            Since our robot is guided by AI rather than human direction, it is highly likely that it will approach game elements like mogos or rings slightly off-center. To counter this, our bot has built in mechanisms that increase our margins of error.
                            <br>
                            Our mogo possession mechanism uses a 3D printed aligner perfectly shaped around the profile of a mogo to allow for the mogo to “lock into place” as we run into it.
                            <br>
                            Our ring intake is wider than most other VEX VRC robots to increase our chances of successfully intaking rings.

                            Unlike alliance mogos, neutral mogos can give points to either team, making them especially important. The 15” is designed primarily to control neutral mogos, using the 15 second isolation period to grab two mogos with its front and back clamps. During the interactive period, it attempts to balance with both mogos on our alliance platform for additional points.

                            In order to meet the 15” design constraints for this robot, we use custom parts extensively.
                            <li>Usage of ⅛” delrin as well as VEX gears milled to half their original thickness provides a low profile drive.</li>
                            <li>Usage of ¼” delrin for the lift allows for a compact design out of material stronger than vex c-channel with easy mounting points for the VEX V5 brain.</li>
                            <li>3D printed motor mounts half an inch shorter than the original VEX mounts maximize space in the middle of the drive for electronics.</li>
                            <li>Delrin on both the drive and the lift allows us to laser cut holes for ball bearings for reduced friction.</li>
