                <h3>Motivation behind design.</h3>
                <p>
                    We use a holonomic x-drive as its strafing capabilities allow great maneuverability. However due to their angled wheels, X-drives are weak and bulky, so we use laser cut wheel hubs designed in CAD to make the most of our space with two motor mounts each for increased torque.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="x-drive.png" alt="x-drive" id="robot-24">

                    <br>
                    Margins of error: Since AI robots are prone to inaccuracies, our bot is designed to work as expected even when approaching game elements slightly off-center.
                    <br>
                    Our mogo possession mechanism uses a 3D printed aligner perfectly shaped around the profile of a mogo to allow for the mogo to “lock into place” as we run into it.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Our ring intake is wider than most other VEX robots to increase our chances of successfully intaking rings.
                    <br>

                <h2>Code layout</h2>
                <h3>Jetson Nano</h3>
                <p>
                    We use the YOLOv5 object detection model to generate bounding boxes around mogos and rings from video feed provided by our IntelRealsense LIDAR cameras. These bounding boxes as well as depth readings from the LIDAR give us exact positions of all game elements in frame.
                    <br>

                    <img src="yolo.gif" alt="yolo" id="robot-24">

                    <br>
                    Our program ran at 1.6 FPS November of 2021. With the following speed ups, our program runs at 8 FPS as of May 2022. 
                    <br>
                    Usage of the TensorRT framework allowed us to transfer YOLOv5 computations from the nano's CPU to its much faster GPU.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Building the IntelRealsense drivers using CUDA rather than default settings allowed us to transfer camera frame processing tasks from the CPU to the GPU.
                    <br>
                    Powering the Jetson Nano through its GPIO pins in addition to the default barrel jack port allows us to supply the Nano with extra voltage and processing power.
                </p>
                <h3>Robot/Nano communications</h3>
                <p>
                    A list of all object locations computed by the Nano is sent to the brain through a serial cable connecting the two. 
                </p>
                <h3>V5 Brain</h3>
                <p>
                    Once a list of data has been sent over to the V5 brain, we cross-check them against “deadzones” that the robot is not allowed to enter. For example, our robot should not be attempting to intake rings located under the balance. Once we determine which objects from this list are valid targets, we select the closest one and tell our robot to navigate towards it.

                    Divide the field into 36 equally sized boxes.
                    <br>
                    Using the position of our robot and all outputs from our object detection algorithm, update each box with information about the number of rings and mogos inside at any given time. 
                    <br>
                    Allows for the robot to have short term “memory” about the layout of areas of the field it has recently seen.

                <h3>Bot design</h3>
                <h4>Motivation behind design: In order to meet the 15" design constraints for this robot, we use custom parts extensively.</h4>
                <p>
                    Usage of ⅛” delrin as well as VEX gears milled to half their original thickness provides a low profile drive and compatibility with ball-bearings for reduced friction. 3D printed motor mounts half an inch shorter than the original VEX mounts maximize space in the middle of the drive for electronics.
                    <br>
                    Usage of ¼” delrin for the lift allows for a compact design compatible with bearings as well as easy mounting points for the VEX V5 brain.
